## prepare.sh
- I started by generating the raw dataset (ms_dirty_data.csv) using the generate_dirty_data.py script. Next, I cleaned the dataset by removing comment lines, empty lines, and extra commas, and extracted only the essential columns: patient_id, visit_date, age, education_level, and walking_speed. I saved the cleaned data into a new file called ms_data.csv. I also created a separate file, insurance.lst, which lists unique insurance types (Basic, Premium, Platinum) with a header. To summarize the cleaned data, I calculated the total number of visits and displayed the count. Finally, I reviewed the cleaned dataset by printing the first few records to verify the output.
