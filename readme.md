## prepare.sh
- I started by generating the raw dataset (ms_dirty_data.csv) using the generate_dirty_data.py script. Next, I cleaned the dataset by removing comment lines, empty lines, and extra commas, and extracted only the essential columns: patient_id, visit_date, age, education_level, and walking_speed. I saved the cleaned data into a new file called ms_data.csv. I also created a separate file, insurance.lst, which lists unique insurance types (Basic, Premium, Platinum) with a header. To summarize the cleaned data, I calculated the total number of visits and displayed the count. Finally, I reviewed the cleaned dataset by printing the first few records to verify the output.


## analyze_visits.py
- I loaded and prepared the cleaned dataset by converting dates to datetime format and sorting the data by patient_id and visit_date. Using the separate insurance file (insurance.lst), I assigned a consistent random insurance type to each patient and calculated visit costs based on the insurance type with some random variation. Finally, I analyzed the data by computing the mean walking speed by education level, the average visit costs by insurance type, and the relationship between age groups and walking speed.


## stats_analysis.py
- I performed a series of analyses on walking speed, insurance costs, and various factors that could influence them. First, I ran a multiple regression model to investigate the impact of age and education level on walking speed. Then, I conducted a trend analysis over time to see how walking speed changes as time since the first visit increases, while also considering the effects of age and education. Additionally, I used ANOVA to compare insurance costs across different insurance types and calculated Cohen’s d to measure the effect size between Basic and Premium insurance. Finally, I performed a mixed-effects model to test for interaction effects between age and education on walking speed, while noting issues with model convergence that might need further attention.
- The analysis of walking speed, insurance costs, and various predictors showed several important findings. The multiple regression model showed that both age and education level significantly impacted walking speed, with higher education levels generally associated with better walking speed, while age was negatively correlated with walking speed. 
- The trend analysis over time indicated that walking speed slightly decreased as time since the first visit increased, but education and age remained significant predictors. 
- ANOVA analysis comparing insurance types found significant differences in visit costs across the groups, with Platinum insurance being associated with the highest costs, followed by Premium and Basic. Cohen’s d revealed a very large effect size between Basic and Premium insurance costs. 
- The mixed-effects model exploring interaction effects between age and education on walking speed found no significant interaction, suggesting that the effects of age and education on walking speed were independent of each other. Convergence warnings in the mixed-effects models indicate potential issues with model fitting, which might require further optimization.
